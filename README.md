The Pharmacy Inventory Management App helps pharmacies run smoothly by managing prescriptions, 
billing, and stock. It ensures pharmacies only give out medicines when patients have valid prescriptions 
from trusted doctors in a central database. There are two types of users: Pharmacy staff and 
Administrators. Pharmacy staff handle sales, create bills, and update stock through a simple interface, 
while administrators can see everything happening across all pharmacies, including sales and stock 
levels.
When a patient brings in a prescription, the app checks if the doctor is approved. If the prescription is 
valid, a bill is created based on the amount and cost of the medicines, and the stock is updated right away. 
The app helps make sure pharmacies do not run out of medicine or sell more than they have.
Administrators can view reports on sales and stock, with options to filter data by pharmacy, date, or 
medicine. All records of sales and prescriptions are saved securely for future reviews, helping keep 
everything transparent.
Overall, the app makes it easier for pharmacies to manage their work, while giving administrators the 
tools they need to monitor and ensure everything runs smoothly and follows medical guidelines.
